## üìñ **Detailed Notes**

### **1. Relational Algebra**

#### **Overview**

- **Purpose:** Defines operations that manipulate relations (tables).
- **Key Properties:**
  - **Closure:** Result of any operation is always a relation.
  - **Operations:**
    - Unary: Selection (œÉ), Projection (œÄ)
    - Binary: Cartesian Product (√ó), Join (‚ãà), Set Operations (‚à™, ‚à©, ‚àí)

#### **Key Operations**

1. **Projection (œÄ):**

   - Selects specific columns from a relation.
   - **Example SQL:**
     ```sql
     SELECT A1, A4 FROM Ausgangstabelle;
     ```

2. **Selection (œÉ):**

   - Filters rows based on a condition.
   - **Example SQL:**
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM Tabelle WHERE A1 > 30;
     ```

3. **Cartesian Product (√ó):**

   - Combines every row of two relations.
   - **Example SQL:**
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM R1, R2;
     ```

4. **Join Operations (‚ãà):**

   - Combines relations based on matching attributes.
   - Types: Theta Join, Equi-Join, Natural Join, Outer Join.
   - **Example SQL:**
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM R NATURAL JOIN S;
     ```

5. **Set Operations:**
   - **Union (‚à™):**
     Combines rows from two relations.
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM R1 UNION SELECT * FROM R2;
     ```
   - **Intersection (‚à©):**
     Returns common rows.
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM R1 INTERSECT SELECT * FROM R2;
     ```
   - **Difference (‚àí):**
     Returns rows in R1 not in R2.
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM R1 EXCEPT SELECT * FROM R2;
     ```

### **2. Normalization**

#### **Purpose:**

- Ensure data integrity by eliminating redundancy and anomalies.
- Use Normal Forms (NF) to systematically refine database design.

#### **Normal Forms Overview**

1. **1NF:**

   - All attributes must have atomic (indivisible) values.
   - **Violation Example:** Lists or sets as column values.
   - **Solution:** Split multi-valued attributes into separate rows.

2. **2NF:**

   - Satisfies 1NF, and every non-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
   - **Violation Example:** Partial dependency in composite keys.
   - **Solution:** Split tables into smaller ones.

3. **3NF:**

   - Satisfies 2NF, and no transitive dependencies exist.
   - **Violation Example:** Non-key attribute dependent on another non-key attribute.
   - **Solution:** Create separate tables for transitively dependent attributes.

4. **BCNF (Boyce-Codd):**
   - Extends 3NF to address overlapping composite keys.
   - **Violation Example:** Functional dependency where determinant is not a superkey.

---

### **3. Anomalies and Denormalization**

- **Anomalies:**
  - **Insert:** Cannot add data without related existing data.
  - **Delete:** Removing data can unintentionally delete related information.
  - **Update:** Redundant data changes inconsistently.
- **Denormalization:**
  - Introduces redundancy for performance gains.
  - Example: Combining customer and order data in a single table for faster queries.

### **4. Case Study: "Projekt-Zuteilung"**

#### **From 1NF to 3NF**

- **Initial Schema (1NF):**

  ```sql
  PERSNR | NAME   | WOHNORT | PROJNR | ProAnteil | PLNr | PLName
  ```

- **2NF:**

  - Split attributes depending on subsets of composite keys:
    ```sql
    PERSNR | NAME   | WOHNORT
    PROJNR | PLNr   | PLName
    PERSNR | PROJNR | ProAnteil
    ```

- **3NF:**
  - Remove transitive dependencies:
    ```sql
    PROJNR | PLNr
    PLNr   | PLName
    ```
