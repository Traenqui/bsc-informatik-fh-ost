## üìñ **Detailed Notes**

### **1. Database Design Process**

- **Steps:**
  1. **Requirements Analysis:** Define information and data processing needs.
  2. **Conceptual Design:** Create conceptual models like UML or ER diagrams.
  3. **Logical Design:** Map conceptual models to logical database structures.
  4. **Physical Design:** Optimize schemas for the DBMS and hardware.

---

### **2. UML Class Diagrams**

- **Key Elements:**
  - Attributes (e.g., `Name`, `Age`, `Race`).
  - Inheritance types:
    - **Disjoint ({disjoint}):** An object belongs to only one subclass.
    - **Overlapping ({overlapping}):** An object can belong to multiple subclasses.
    - **Complete ({complete}):** All superclass objects must be instances of a subclass.
    - **Incomplete ({incomplete}):** Some superclass objects may not belong to any subclass.

---

### **3. Normal Forms**

#### **2nd Normal Form (2NF):**

- **Requirement:**
  - Remove partial dependencies.
  - Ensure full functional dependency on the primary key.

#### **3rd Normal Form (3NF):**

- **Requirement:**
  - Eliminate transitive dependencies.
  - Example:
    ```plaintext
    trait_id -> trait_name
    trait_id -> description
    race_id, trait_id -> specification
    ```

#### **Normalization Practice:**

- Decompose tables into multiple normalized forms to achieve 3NF.

---

### **4. Data Definition Language (DDL)**

#### **Schema Design:**

1. **Inheritance (Regel 3.a, 3.b, 3.c):**

   - **3.a:** Separate tables for superclass and subclasses with references.
   - **3.b:** Only subclass tables, each with unique attributes.
   - **3.c:** One table for all, using nullable attributes and a `type` column.

2. **One-to-Many Relationships:**

   - Foreign key resides on the "many" side.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE item (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
       name TEXT NOT NULL,
       person INTEGER REFERENCES person(id)
     );
     ```

3. **Many-to-Many Relationships:**
   - Use a join table:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE skill_person (
       skill_id INTEGER REFERENCES skill(id),
       person_id INTEGER REFERENCES person(id),
       PRIMARY KEY(skill_id, person_id)
     );
     ```

### **5. Data Manipulation Language (DML)**

- **Key Queries:**
  1. Insert data:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO race(id, name) VALUES (1, 'Human'), (2, 'Elf');
     ```
  2. Aggregations:
     ```sql
     SELECT item_typ, AVG(value) FROM item GROUP BY item_typ;
     ```
  3. Joins:
     ```sql
     SELECT p.name, c.name AS city
     FROM person p
     JOIN city c ON p.city = c.id;
     ```
  4. Subqueries:
     ```sql
     SELECT name FROM item WHERE value > (SELECT MIN(value) FROM item WHERE item_typ = 1);
     ```

---

### **6. Transactions and ACID Properties**

- **ACID Breakdown:**

  1. **Atomicity:** All operations succeed or none do.
  2. **Consistency:** Transactions move the database from one consistent state to another.
  3. **Isolation:** Transactions are executed as if they were serial.
  4. **Durability:** Committed changes are permanent.

- **Example:**

  ```sql
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  UPDATE item SET person = 2 WHERE person = 1 AND name = 'Sword';
  COMMIT;
  ```

- **Concurrency Control:**
  - **Two-Phase Locking (2PL):** Ensures serializability but may lead to deadlocks.
  - **Snapshot Isolation (SI):** Avoids conflicts by working with snapshots.

---

### **7. Indexing**

- **Index Types in PostgreSQL:**

  - **B-Tree:** General-purpose, supports equality and range queries.
  - **GIN:** Ideal for JSON and full-text search.
  - **BRIN:** Lightweight, effective for large datasets.

- **Example:**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_item_name ON item(name);
  ```

---

### **8. Data Control Language (DCL)**

- **Commands:**
  1. Create user:
     ```sql
     CREATE USER sc_admin WITH PASSWORD '1234';
     ```
  2. Grant privileges:
     ```sql
     GRANT SELECT ON sword_coast_residents TO sc_admin;
     ```
  3. Create roles:
     ```sql
     CREATE ROLE group_name WITH LOGIN;
     ```
