## üìñ **Detailed Notes**

### **1. Isolation Levels**

- Defined by ANSI SQL-92 Standards:

  1. **READ UNCOMMITTED:**
     - Transactions may read uncommitted data ("dirty reads").
  2. **READ COMMITTED (Default in PostgreSQL):**
     - Only committed data is readable.
  3. **REPEATABLE READ:**
     - Prevents non-repeatable reads; no changes visible during a transaction.
  4. **SERIALIZABLE:**
     - Provides the highest isolation; transactions execute as if serialized.

- **PostgreSQL Configuration:**
  ```sql
  SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
  BEGIN;
  -- Transaction Statements
  COMMIT;
  ```

---

### **2. Common Transaction Anomalies**

- **Dirty Read:**
  - Reading uncommitted changes from another transaction.
  - **Example:**
    ```sql
    T1: SELECT * FROM Account WHERE Owner = 'Bob'; -- sees uncommitted changes by T2
    T2: UPDATE Account SET Balance = 0 WHERE Owner = 'Bob'; ROLLBACK;
    ```
- **Non-Repeatable Read (Fuzzy Read):**
  - Repeated reads yield different results due to another transaction's updates.
- **Phantom Read:**
  - New rows appear or existing rows disappear during a transaction.
- **Serialization Anomaly:**
  - Results differ from serial execution of transactions.

---

### **3. Snapshot Isolation (SI)**

- **Definition:**
  - Each transaction works with a consistent snapshot of the database at its start time.
  - Write conflicts are resolved at commit time.
- **Advantages:**
  - Readers don‚Äôt block writers and vice versa.
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Does not guarantee serializability (e.g., Write Skew Anomalies).

#### **Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI):**

- **Implementation:**
  - Detects conflicts dynamically and aborts transactions that violate serializability.
- **PostgreSQL Implementation:**
  - Available for `REPEATABLE READ` and `SERIALIZABLE` isolation levels since PostgreSQL 9.1.

---

### **4. Implementation in PostgreSQL**

- **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC):**
  - Maintains multiple versions of a tuple.
  - Each transaction sees the latest version valid at its start time.
- **Advantages of MVCC:**
  - Avoids reader-writer blocking.
  - Reduces contention in high-concurrency systems.
- **Conflict Resolution:**
  - Transactions encountering a write conflict are rolled back.

---

### **5. Optimistic and Pessimistic Concurrency Control**

#### **Pessimistic Methods:**

- Locking is used to prevent conflicts.
- **Two-Phase Locking (2PL):**
  - **Growing Phase:** Acquires all locks.
  - **Shrinking Phase:** Releases locks.
- **Advantages:**
  - Ensures serializability.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - May cause deadlocks.

#### **Optimistic Methods:**

- Assumes minimal conflicts and resolves them at commit time.
- **Snapshot Isolation:** Uses versioning to handle conflicts.

---

### **6. Conflict and Deadlock Resolution**

#### **Deadlock Detection:**

- Use a Wait-For Graph to detect cycles.
- Abort one of the transactions in the cycle.

#### **Deadlock Prevention:**

1. **Timeouts:** Transactions waiting too long are aborted.
2. **Lock Ordering:** Enforce a global order for acquiring locks.

#### **Conflict Resolution in PostgreSQL:**

- Rollback transactions violating consistency.

---

### **7. Exercises and Best Practices**

- **Practice:**
  - Experiment with different isolation levels and analyze anomalies.
  - Explore deadlock scenarios and resolution strategies.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use `SERIALIZABLE` for critical operations requiring consistency.
  - Monitor for long-running transactions to avoid conflicts.

---

## ‚ùì **Questions Raised**

- How does PostgreSQL implement deadlock detection in large-scale systems?
- What are the trade-offs between using SI and SSI for high-concurrency workloads?

## üìå **Summary**

- **Main Takeaways:**
  - Isolation levels define trade-offs between consistency and concurrency.
  - Snapshot Isolation improves concurrency but does not guarantee serializability.
  - PostgreSQL‚Äôs MVCC efficiently implements SI and SSI for transactional consistency.
- **Connection to Previous Content:**
  - Builds on the foundational concepts of ACID properties and transaction management.
