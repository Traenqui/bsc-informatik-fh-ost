## üß† **Learning Objectives**

- Explain memory-mapped I/O and port-mapped I/O mechanisms.

## üìñ **Detailed Notes**

### **1. Introduction to Input and Output Devices**

- **Input Devices:**
  - Convert physical events to data (e.g., keyboard detects key presses, mouse detects movement).
- **Output Devices:**
  - Convert data to physical actions (e.g., screen sets pixels, speakers generate sound).
- **Combined I/O Devices:**
  - Devices like hard drives and network cards handle both input and output operations.

---

### **2. Data Communication Between CPU and Devices**

- Communication is based on registers:
  - **Command Register:** Sends instructions to the device.
  - **Status Register:** Provides the device's current status.
  - **Data Register:** Transfers data to/from the device.
- Address and data buses facilitate access.

---

### **3. Memory-Mapped I/O**

- Devices share the system's memory address space.

  - Advantages: Simplicity; CPU uses standard memory instructions.
  - Disadvantages: Reduced memory space for other purposes.

- **Port-Mapped I/O:**
  - Separate address space for devices.
  - Advantages: Full memory address space remains usable.
  - Disadvantages: Increased system complexity.

---

### **4. Polling Mechanisms**

- **Polling with Busy Wait:**
  - CPU continuously checks the device.
  - Pros: Low latency.
  - Cons: Inefficient CPU usage.
- **Polling Without Busy Wait:**
  - CPU checks devices periodically, performing other tasks in between.

---

### **5. Interrupt Mechanism**

- **Process:**
  - Device signals readiness via an interrupt.
  - CPU pauses current task, executes an interrupt handler, and resumes.
- **Setup:**
  - Interrupt Controller manages device signals and directs the CPU using an interrupt vector table.
- **Challenges:**
  - Requires careful context management.
  - Interrupt nesting and non-maskable interrupts (NMI) can add complexity.

---

### **6. Direct Memory Access (DMA)**

- DMA controller manages memory transfers between devices and memory independently of the CPU.
- Modes of Operation:
  - **Single Transfer:** Suitable for devices with low data rates.
  - **Block Transfer:** Efficient for high-throughput devices like disks.

---

### **7. Driver Architecture**

- **Without Drivers:**
  - User programs directly manage hardware, increasing complexity and instability.
- **With Drivers:**
  - Drivers provide a standardized interface, ensuring security and stability.
- **Microkernel Approach:**
  - Drivers operate in user mode, enhancing system stability at the cost of potential performance trade-offs.

---

## ‚ùì **Questions Raised**

- How does DMA improve system performance in virtualized environments?
- What are the limitations of polling in real-time systems?

---

## üìå **Summary**

- **Main Takeaways:**
  - Efficient input/output is critical for system performance.
  - OS abstracts hardware complexities using driver architectures.
- **Connection to Previous Content:**
  - Builds on memory management concepts (e.g., MMU and virtual memory).

---

## ‚úÖ **Action Items**

- Review interrupt vector tables and their handling in x86 systems.
- Research differences in microkernel implementations across popular OS.

---

### **Lecture Review**
