## üìñ **Detailed Notes**

### **1. Semester Review**

#### **Prozessorgrundlagen (Processor Basics)**

- Processors execute instructions sequentially from memory.
- Instructions are CPU-specific and must be translated to binary machine code.
- Key concepts:
  - Processors use internal flags to determine states (e.g., overflow, zero).
  - Communication with memory occurs via the memory bus.

#### **Hauptspeicher und Cache (Main Memory and Cache)**

- **Caches:** Store frequently used data to minimize latency due to slower main memory.
  - Types:
    - Fully Associative Cache (FAC)
    - Direct Mapped Cache (DMC)
    - Set Associative Cache (SAC)
- **Locality Principles:**
  - Temporal: Repeated use of the same data.
  - Spatial: Use of data stored close together.

#### **Virtueller Speicher (Virtual Memory)**

- Programs interact with virtual addresses; MMU translates to physical addresses.
- Concepts:
  - Pages and Frames: Pages reside in frames of equal size.
  - Strategies:
    - Single-Level Paging: Simple but inefficient.
    - Multi-Level Paging: Complex but space-efficient.

#### **Ein-/Ausgabe (Input/Output)**

- Communication types:
  - **Polling:** CPU checks device status regularly.
  - **Interrupts:** Device signals the CPU asynchronously.
  - **DMA:** Devices directly access main memory.

### **3. Preview of Next Semester**

#### **Topics**

1. **OS API:**
   - Interaction between processes and OS using arguments, environment variables, and POSIX standards.
2. **File Systems:**
   - Logical: File descriptors, handles, and POSIX-C interactions.
   - Physical: ext2/ext4, journaling, and FAT file systems.
3. **Multithreading:**
   - Differences between processes and threads.
   - APIs like POSIX and thread synchronization tools.
4. **Scheduling:**
   - Cooperative vs. preemptive multitasking.
   - Scheduling metrics and strategies.
5. **Synchronization:**
   - Avoiding race conditions with semaphores and mutexes.
   - Addressing priority inversion.
6. **Interprocess Communication:**
   - Mechanisms like signals, message passing, and shared memory.
   - Networking basics, including sockets.

## ‚ùì **Questions Raised**

- How does multi-level paging improve memory efficiency compared to single-level paging?
- What are the practical trade-offs of cache types like FAC, DMC, and SAC?

### **Lecture Review**

- **What I Learned:**
  - Detailed review of semester topics and introduction to advanced OS concepts for next semester.
- **What Needs Clarification:**
  - Deeper understanding of file system structures (ext4 vs. FAT) and journaling mechanisms.
- **My Plan to Review This Material:**
  - Dedicate time to solving practice exams and summarizing theoretical content into notes.
