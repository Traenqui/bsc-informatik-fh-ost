- Pass arrays, strings, and structs as function parameters.


## üìñ **Detailed Notes**

### **1. Primitive Data Types**
- **Types in C:**
  - `char`: Single machine byte.
  - `int`: Natural bit width of the processor (signed by default).
  - `void *`: Machine word interpreted as an address.
- **Predefined Integer Aliases:**
  - `int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, int64_t`: Fixed-width integers.
  - `intptr_t`: Integer type capable of holding an address.
  - `size_t`: Unsigned integer large enough to represent the size of an object.


### **2. Memory Representation**
- **Assembly Perspective:**
  - Data types do not exist at the machine code level.
  - Memory is viewed as bits grouped into bytes.
- **Size of Data Types:**
  - `sizeof`: Compile-time operator to determine object or type size in bytes.
  - Example:
    ```c
    uint32_t a[] = {1, 2, 3};
    size_t n = sizeof a / sizeof a[0]; // Number of elements
    ```


### **3. Pointers and Arrays**
#### **Pointer Arithmetic:**
- Incrementing a pointer considers the size of the data type it points to.
  ```c
  uint64_t *p = 0xA00;
  ++p; // p == 0xA08
  ```
- Pointer difference accounts for type size:
  ```c
  int32_t *x = 120, *y = 100;
  ptrdiff_t diff = x - y; // diff == 5
  ```

#### **Arrays:**
- **Declaration:**
  ```c
  int a[10]; // Reserves space for 10 integers
  ```
- **Array as Pointer:**
  - Array labels are constant pointers.
  - Example:
    ```c
    int32_t *p = a; // Address of array's first element
    ```


### **4. Strings**
- **Null-Terminated Strings:**
  - Char arrays ending with `\0`.
  - Example:
    ```c
    char s[] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};
    ```
- **String Functions (from `<string.h>`):**
  - `strlen`: Length of a string.
    ```c
    size_t strlen(char const *str) {
        char const *p = str;
        while (*p) ++p;
        return p - str;
    }
    ```


### **5. Structs and Memory Layout**
#### **Structs:**
- **Definition:**
  ```c
  struct Point {
      int x;
      int y;
  };
  struct Point p = {10, 20};
  ```
- **Memory Alignment:**
  - Compiler may insert padding to align members.
  - Example:
    ```c
    struct {
        char c;  // Offset 0
        int x;   // Offset 4
    }; // sizeof == 8 (padding added)
    ```

#### **Unions:**
- **Definition:**
  - All members share the same memory location.
  - Example:
    ```c
    union Data {
        int i;
        float f;
    };
    ```
- **Use Case:**
  - Avoid type casting by interpreting memory differently.
  - Example:
    ```c
    union U {
        int kind;
        struct { int kind; char value[256]; } str;
    };
    ```


### **6. Type Casting**
- **Implicit Casting:**
  - Between compatible types (e.g., `int` to `float`).
- **Explicit Casting:**
  - Required for incompatible types.
  - Example:
    ```c
    int *p = (int *) 0xA00; // Cast address to integer pointer
    ```
- **Best Practices:**
  - Avoid casts unless necessary.
  - Document reasons for casting.


### **7. Best Practices and Pitfalls**
- **Avoid Using Uninitialized Variables:**
  - Local variables are not automatically initialized.
- **Be Cautious with Global Variables:**
  - Persist across function calls, leading to potential data corruption in recursion.
- **Understand Type Limits:**
  - Implicit conversions between `signed` and `unsigned` types can lead to unexpected results.


## ‚ùì **Questions Raised**
- What are the practical limitations of using unions for type interpretation?
- How does memory alignment affect performance and memory usage?

## üìå **Summary**
- **Main Takeaways:**
  - C types are abstractions; their layout and size depend on hardware and compiler.
  - Arrays and pointers form the backbone of C's memory management.
  - Strings are simple null-terminated char arrays but require careful handling.
  - Structs and unions offer flexible ways to manage memory and data interpretation.
