## üß† **Learning Objectives**
- Explain the mechanism of page-based virtual memory.
- Understand the purpose and working of the Memory Management Unit (MMU).
- Describe the different implementations of page tables and their trade-offs.


## üìñ **Detailed Notes**

### **1. Virtual Memory and Process Isolation**
- **Purpose:**
  - Isolate processes to prevent unauthorized memory access.
  - Map virtual addresses used by processes to physical addresses managed by the OS.
- **Protection:**
  - Prevents access to OS and other processes' memory.
  - Errors within a process remain isolated.


### **2. Memory Management Unit (MMU)**
- **Functionality:**
  - Translates virtual addresses to physical addresses.
  - Handles memory access protection.
- **Key Features:**
  - Virtual addresses are process-specific.
  - Uses a **Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)** for caching address translations.


### **3. Paging and Page Tables**
- **Paging Basics:**
  - Virtual memory is divided into fixed-size blocks called pages.
  - Corresponding blocks in physical memory are called page frames.
  - Standard page size: 4 KB.
- **Page Tables:**
  - Store mappings between pages and frames.
  - Each process has its own page table.
  - MMU accesses page tables to translate addresses.


### **4. Page Table Implementations**
#### **Single-Level Page Table:**
- **Structure:**
  - Array indexed by the virtual page number.
  - Contains frame number and status bits.
- **Advantages:**
  - Simple and fast lookup.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Memory-intensive for large virtual address spaces.

#### **Two-Level Page Table:**
- **Structure:**
  - Splits the page number into two indices:
    - Directory index (points to page table).
    - Page table index (points to frame).
- **Advantages:**
  - Reduces memory requirements for unused pages.

#### **Multi-Level Page Table:**
- **Structure:**
  - Additional hierarchy for managing very large address spaces.
- **Applications:**
  - Used in modern x86-64 systems.

#### **Inverted Page Table:**
- **Structure:**
  - One entry per frame, shared across all processes.
- **Advantages:**
  - Scales well with physical memory size.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Complex and slower lookups.

#### **Hashed Page Table:**
- **Structure:**
  - Hashes the virtual page number to an index.
  - Linked lists handle hash collisions.
- **Advantages:**
  - Efficient with TLB support.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Slower for collision-heavy scenarios.


### **5. Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)**
- **Purpose:**
  - Cache recent address translations to speed up memory access.
- **Example:**
  - Intel i7 Skylake:
    - Instruction TLB: 128 entries, 8-way associative.
    - Data TLB: 64 entries, 4-way associative.
    - Second-level TLB: 1536 entries, 12-way associative.


### **6. Virtual Memory Benefits**
- **Memory Protection:**
  - Ensures processes do not interfere with each other.
- **Flexible Address Spaces:**
  - Processes can use virtual addresses independent of physical memory layout.
- **Efficient Use of Memory:**
  - OS can swap inactive pages to secondary storage.


## ‚ùì **Questions Raised**
- How does TLB miss handling affect performance in real-time systems?
- What are the practical trade-offs between single-level and multi-level page tables?

## üìå **Summary**
- **Main Takeaways:**
  - Virtual memory isolates processes and provides flexible address space usage.
  - Page tables are essential for translating virtual addresses to physical ones.
