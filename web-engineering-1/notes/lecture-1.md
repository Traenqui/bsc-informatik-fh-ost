## üìñ **Detailed Notes**

### **1. Overview of Web Applications**

- **Key Points:**
  - Web applications consist of multiple layers.
  - Users typically interact only with the frontend (e.g., YouTube interface).
  - Backend processes (e.g., data storage) and network communication are invisible but essential.
  - Example questions:
    - Where does YouTube store videos?
    - How does Google locate webpages?
- **Important Concepts:**
  - Web applications rely on seamless interaction between visible (frontend) and invisible (backend) components.

---

### **2. Architecture of Web Applications**

- **Key Points:**
  - Main components:
    - **Frontend**: User Interface (UI) visible in the browser.
    - **Backend**: Business logic and data access.
    - **Network**: Communication using protocols like HTTP.
    - **External Systems (Umsysteme)**: Third-party integrations like payment gateways.
  - Example Architecture:
    - A user action triggers frontend logic (e.g., JavaScript function).
    - Network communication sends a request to the backend.
    - The backend processes the request, communicates with databases, and responds.
- **Diagram**:
  ```
  User ‚Üí Frontend (Browser) ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Backend ‚Üí Database/Services
  ```

### **3. Practical Example: Ordering a Ball**

- **Key Points:**
  - **Scenario**: A Unihockey ball-ordering app integrated with a Smart Factory.
  - Workflow:
    - User clicks a button in the browser.
    - The frontend sends an order request via network to the backend.
    - The backend coordinates with the Smart Factory to produce the ball.
    - Confirmation is sent back to the user.
  - **Code Snippet Example**:
    ```javascript
    onclick = "orderBall()";
    function orderBall() {
      sendOrderRequest();
    }
    ```

### **4. Core Technologies**

- **Frontend Technologies**:
  - HTML: Defines structure and content.
  - CSS: Handles design and layout.
  - JavaScript: Implements interactivity and event handling.
- **Backend Technologies**:
  - Common languages: Node.js, PHP, Java, C++.
  - Supports communication with databases and external systems.
- **Network Protocols**:
  - HTTP: Core protocol for web communication.
  - Examples include REST and RPC paradigms.

### **5. Organizational Information**

- **Course Structure**:
  - Weekly schedule: 2 hours lecture, 2 hours self-study, 2 hours exercises, 1 hour follow-up.
  - Topics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, REST, etc.
- **Assessment**:
  - Testat (practical assignment) required to take the exam.
  - Written exam: 120 minutes, allows personal notes (6 pages).
- **Study Tips**:
  - Complete preparation materials before lectures.
  - Utilize resources like JetBrains WebStorm and browser Developer Tools for debugging.
