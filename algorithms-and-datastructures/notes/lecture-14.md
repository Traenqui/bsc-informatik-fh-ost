## üìñ **Detailed Notes**

### **1. Minimum Spanning Trees (MST)**

- **Definition:**

  - A spanning tree is a subgraph that includes all vertices of the graph and forms a tree.
  - An MST minimizes the total edge weight among all possible spanning trees.

- **Applications:**
  - Network design (e.g., communication, transportation).
  - Cost optimization in resource allocation.

---

### **2. Key Properties**

#### **Loop Property:**

- If a graph edge $e$ not in the MST creates a cycle $C$ when added to the MST:
  - The edge $e$ has the highest weight in $C$.
  - Removing $e$ and adding any other edge from $C$ still results in an MST.

#### **Partition Property:**

- For a graph split into two vertex sets $U$ and $V$, the minimum-weight edge between $U$ and $V$ must be part of any MST.

---

### **3. MST Construction Algorithms**

#### **Kruskal‚Äôs Algorithm**

- **Approach:**
  1. Sort all edges by weight.
  2. Use a disjoint-set data structure to keep track of connected components.
  3. Add edges to the MST in increasing order of weight, ensuring no cycles are formed.
- **Data Structure:**
  - Disjoint-set (union-find).
  - Operations: $\text{find(u)}$ and $\text{union(u, v)}$.
- **Complexity:**
  - $O(m \log n)$ with $m$ edges and $n$ vertices.

#### **Prim-Jarnik‚Äôs Algorithm**

- **Approach:**
  1. Start with any vertex and grow the MST one edge at a time.
  2. Maintain a priority queue to select the minimum-weight edge connecting the MST to an outside vertex.
  3. Update the queue as vertices are added to the MST.
- **Data Structure:**
  - Adaptable priority queue.
  - Locator-based methods: $\text{insert(k, e)}$, $\text{replaceKey(l, k)}$.
- **Complexity:**
  - $O((n + m) \log n)$, assuming an adjacency list representation.

#### **Bor≈Øvka‚Äôs Algorithm**

- **Approach:**
  1. Treat each vertex as an individual component.
  2. In each iteration, find the minimum-weight edge connecting each component to others.
  3. Merge components iteratively until only one remains.
- **Complexity:**
  - $O(m \log n)$, with $m$ edges.

### **4. Data Structures for MST Algorithms**

- **Union-Find:**

  - Efficiently tracks connected components during Kruskal‚Äôs algorithm.
  - Operations:
    - $\text{find(u)}$: Returns the set containing vertex $u$.
    - $\text{union(u, v)}$: Merges sets containing $u$ and $v$.
  - Complexity:
    - $O(\log n)$ for union and find operations with path compression and union by rank.

- **Priority Queues:**
  - Used in Prim-Jarnik‚Äôs algorithm to manage edge weights.
  - Supports:
    - $\text{insert(k, e)}$, $\text{removeMin()}$, $\text{replaceKey(l, k)}$.
  - Complexity:
    - $O(\log n)$ for operations on a heap-based structure.
