## üìñ **Detailed Notes**

### **1. Definition and Structure of Splay Trees**

- **Definition:**

  - A splay tree is a self-adjusting binary search tree where recently accessed nodes are moved to the root.
  - Follows standard binary search tree rules:
    - Left subtree contains keys ‚â§ node‚Äôs key.
    - Right subtree contains keys ‚â• node‚Äôs key.
  - An inorder traversal produces keys in sorted order.

- **Unique Property:**
  - After an operation (search, insert, delete), the target node is splayed (moved) to the root via rotations.

---

### **2. Splay Operation and Rotations**

- **Splay Operation:**

  - Performed to move a node `x` to the root using rotations.
  - **Types of Rotations:**
    1. **Zig-Zig (double rotation):** Occurs when `x` and its parent are both left or right children.
    2. **Zig-Zag (double rotation):** Occurs when `x` is a left child and its parent is a right child, or vice versa.
    3. **Zig (single rotation):** Used when `x` is a child of the root.
  - Example:
    - Searching for a node triggers rotations to bring it to the root.

- **Rotation Mechanics:**
  - **Right Rotation:** Moves the left child to the parent position.
  - **Left Rotation:** Moves the right child to the parent position.

### **3. Use Cases of Splay Trees**

- **Dynamic Set Operations:**

  - Frequently accessed elements are closer to the root.
  - Efficient for applications with non-uniform access patterns.

- **Examples:**
  1. **Search:** Brings the target node to the root.
  2. **Insert:** Newly inserted node is splayed to the root.
  3. **Delete:** Splays the node‚Äôs parent to the root after removing the node.

---

### **4. Performance Analysis**

- **Average Complexity:** $O(\log n)$
  - Frequently accessed elements remain near the root.
- **Worst-Case Complexity:** $O(n)$
  - Occurs if the tree degenerates into a linked list structure.
- **Amortized Cost:** $O(\log n)$

  - Over a sequence of operations, the cost of each operation is low.

- **Advantages:**

  - Simpler implementation than AVL or Red-Black Trees.
  - No need to store height or balance factors.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - No strict balance; relies on access frequency for efficiency.

## ‚ùì **Questions Raised**

- What are the specific scenarios where splay trees outperform other balanced search trees?
- How does the splay operation affect long-term tree structure and efficiency?
