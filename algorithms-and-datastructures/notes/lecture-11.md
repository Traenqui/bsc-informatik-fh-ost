## üìñ **Detailed Notes**

### **1. Graph Basics**

#### **Definitions**

- **Graph**: $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is a set of vertices, and $E$ is a set of edges connecting pairs of vertices.

  - **Directed Graph**: Edges have a direction ($(u, v)$).
  - **Undirected Graph**: Edges have no direction ($\{u, v\}$).

- **Path**: Sequence of vertices connected by edges.

  - **Simple Path**: No vertex is repeated.

- **Cycle**: Path that starts and ends at the same vertex.
  - **Simple Cycle**: No edge or vertex is repeated, except for the start/end vertex.

#### **Graph Representations**

- **Edge List**:
  - Stores all edges as pairs of vertices.
- **Adjacency List**:
  - Lists neighbors for each vertex.
  - Space: $O(n + m)$.
- **Adjacency Matrix**:
  - A 2D array indicating edge presence.
  - Space: $O(n^2)$.

#### **Properties**

- Degree: Number of edges incident to a vertex.
- Connected Graph: Path exists between any two vertices.
- Spanning Tree: Subgraph that includes all vertices and is a tree.

### **2. Depth-First Search (DFS)**

#### **Key Points**

- DFS explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking.
- Visits all vertices and edges, determining connectivity and spanning forests.

#### **DFS Algorithm**

1. Start at a vertex $v$, mark it as visited.
2. Recursively visit all unvisited neighbors.
3. Use labels for vertices and edges:

   - **Discovery Edges:** Part of the DFS forest.
   - **Back Edges:** Lead to ancestors, indicating cycles.

   **Pseudocode:**

   ```python
   def DFS(G, v):
       mark v as VISITED
       for each edge (v, w) in G:
           if w is UNVISITED:
               mark (v, w) as DISCOVERY
               DFS(G, w)
           else:
               mark (v, w) as BACK
   ```

#### **Properties**

1. **Traversal Coverage:** Visits all vertices and edges in a component.
2. **Spanning Tree:** Forms a spanning forest for disconnected graphs.
3. **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$ for $n$ vertices and $m$ edges with adjacency lists.

#### **Applications**

- Path Finding:
  - Use DFS with a stack to track paths between vertices.
- Cycle Detection:
  - Identify cycles via back edges during traversal.

### **3. Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

#### **Key Points**

- BFS explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving deeper.
- Forms a level-order traversal.

#### **BFS Algorithm**

1. Initialize a queue with the starting vertex.
2. Process each vertex, enqueue its unvisited neighbors, and mark them as visited.
3. Label edges:

   - **Discovery Edges:** Connect levels.
   - **Cross Edges:** Between already visited vertices.

   **Pseudocode:**

   ```python
   def BFS(G, s):
       queue = [s]
       mark s as VISITED
       while queue is not empty:
           v = dequeue(queue)
           for each edge (v, w) in G:
               if w is UNVISITED:
                   mark (v, w) as DISCOVERY
                   enqueue(queue, w)
               else:
                   mark (v, w) as CROSS
   ```

#### **Properties**

1. **Traversal Coverage:** Visits all vertices and edges in the component.
2. **Shortest Path:** Guarantees the shortest path in terms of edges from the start vertex.
3. **Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$ with adjacency lists.

#### **Applications**

- Shortest Path:
  - Efficiently finds paths with the minimum number of edges.
- Connected Components:
  - Identifies components in undirected graphs.

### **4. Comparison of DFS and BFS**

| Feature              | DFS                        | BFS                     |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Traversal Pattern    | Deep first, then backtrack | Level by level          |
| Time Complexity      | $O(n + m)$                 | $O(n + m)$              |
| Shortest Path        | No                         | Yes (in terms of edges) |
| Spanning Tree/Forest | Yes                        | Yes                     |
| Cycle Detection      | Via back edges             | Less intuitive          |
