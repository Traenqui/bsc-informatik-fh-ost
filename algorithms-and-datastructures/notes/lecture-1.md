## üìñ **Detailed Notes**

### **1. Introduction to Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**

- **Definition:**
  - A binary search tree is a binary tree where:
    - Keys are stored in internal nodes.
    - For each node `v`, keys in the left subtree are ‚â§ `key(v)`.
    - Keys in the right subtree are ‚â• `key(v)`.
- **Traversal:**
  - Inorder traversal visits keys in non-decreasing order.
  - Leaf nodes (external nodes) do not store data.

---

### **2. Operations on Binary Search Trees**

#### **Search**

- **Algorithm:**
  - Start at the root.
  - Compare the target key `k` with the current node's key.
  - Traverse left if `k < key(v)` or right if `k > key(v)`.
  - Stop if `k = key(v)` or a leaf is reached.
- **Example:**
  - Searching for 4 in the BST involves traversing nodes 6 ‚Üí 4.

#### **Insertion**

- **Procedure:**
  - Use the search operation to locate the appropriate leaf.
  - Replace the leaf with a new internal node containing the key.
- **Example:**
  - Inserting 5 expands the tree by adding a new node at the correct position.

#### **Deletion**

- **Cases:**
  1. **Node with two children:**
     - Replace the node with its inorder successor and delete the successor.
  2. **Node with one child:**
     - Remove the node and connect its parent directly to its child.
  3. **Leaf node:**
     - Simply remove the node.
- **Example:**
  - Removing node 3 involves replacing it with its inorder successor.

### **3. Performance Analysis**

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Space: $O(n)$ for `n` entries.
  - Operations (find, insert, remove):
    - $O(h)$, where $h$ is the height of the tree.
    - Best case: $O(\log n)$ (balanced tree).
    - Worst case: $O(n)$ (degenerate tree).
- **Height of BST:**
  - $O(\log n)$ for a balanced tree.
  - $O(n)$ for an unbalanced tree.

### **4. BST Implementation in Java**

#### **Node Class**

```java
public class Node {
    Node leftSon, rightSon;
    int key;

    Node(int key) {
        this.key = key;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return String.valueOf(key);
    }
}
```

#### **Tree Class**

- **Search Method:**

```java
Node search(Node root, int key) {
    if (root == null || root.key == key)
        return root;
    if (key < root.key)
        return search(root.leftSon, key);
    return search(root.rightSon, key);
}
```

- **Insert Method:**

```java
Node insert(Node root, int key) {
    if (root == null)
        return new Node(key);
    if (key < root.key)
        root.leftSon = insert(root.leftSon, key);
    else if (key > root.key)
        root.rightSon = insert(root.rightSon, key);
    return root;
}
```

- **Delete Method:**

```java
Node delete(Node root, int key) {
    if (root == null) return root;
    if (key < root.key)
        root.leftSon = delete(root.leftSon, key);
    else if (key > root.key)
        root.rightSon = delete(root.rightSon, key);
    else {
        if (root.leftSon == null) return root.rightSon;
        if (root.rightSon == null) return root.leftSon;
        Node successor = getInorderSuccessor(root.rightSon);
        root.key = successor.key;
        root.rightSon = delete(root.rightSon, successor.key);
    }
    return root;
}
```
