## 📖 **Detailed Notes**

### **1. Comparison-Based Sorting**

- **Definition:**

  - Sorting algorithms that rely solely on pairwise comparisons of elements.
  - Examples: Bubble-Sort, Selection-Sort, Insertion-Sort, Heap-Sort, Merge-Sort, Quick-Sort.

- **Problem Statement:**
  - Given $n$ elements $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, determine the minimal time complexity achievable for any comparison-based sorting algorithm.

---

### **2. Decision Trees in Sorting**

- **Concept:**

  - A sorting algorithm's execution can be represented as a decision tree.
  - Each internal node corresponds to a comparison (e.g., $x_i < x_j?$).
  - Each leaf represents a possible permutation of $n$ elements.

- **Key Insight:**
  - The height of the decision tree determines the number of comparisons in the worst case.

---

### **3. Lower Bound Analysis**

- **Height of Decision Tree:**

  - For $n$ elements, there are $n!$ permutations.
  - To distinguish between all permutations, the decision tree must have at least $n!$ leaves.

- **Height Calculation:**
  - The minimum height $h$ of a binary tree with $n!$ leaves is $\lceil \log_2(n!) \rceil$.

#### **Stirling’s Approximation:**

- $$
  \log_2(n!) \approx n \log_2(n) - n \log_2(e)
  $$
- Using this, the lower bound becomes:

  $$
  \Omega(n \log_2(n))
  $$

- **Implication:**
  - Any comparison-based sorting algorithm has a minimum runtime of $\Omega(n \log(n))$.

---

### **4. Practical Implications**

- **Optimal Algorithms:**

  - Merge-Sort and Heap-Sort achieve $O(n \log(n))$, matching the lower bound.
  - Quick-Sort achieves $O(n \log(n))$ on average but may degrade to $O(n^2)$ in the worst case.

- **Non-Comparison-Based Sorting:**
  - Algorithms like Radix-Sort or Bucket-Sort bypass the $\Omega(n \log(n))$ lower bound by leveraging additional properties of the data, such as numerical ranges.

---

## ❓ **Questions Raised**

1. How do practical considerations (e.g., memory usage) affect the choice of sorting algorithms?
2. What are the trade-offs between comparison-based and non-comparison-based sorting?
