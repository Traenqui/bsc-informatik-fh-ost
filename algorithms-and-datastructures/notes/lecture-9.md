## üìñ **Detailed Notes**

### **1. Introduction to Tries**

- **Definition:**

  - A trie (prefix tree) is a data structure used to store strings in a way that facilitates fast retrieval, especially for common prefixes.
  - Ideal for pattern matching tasks where preprocessing can optimize search operations.

- **Key Advantage:**
  - Pattern matching time is proportional to the pattern length.

---

### **2. Standard Tries**

#### **Structure:**

- Ordered tree where:
  - Each node represents a character.
  - Paths from the root to external nodes represent strings.

#### **Operations:**

1. **Insert:**
   - Add a string by creating nodes for each character.
2. **Search:**
   - Traverse the tree along the characters of the string.

#### **Performance:**

- Space: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the total length of all strings.
- Time for operations:
  - **Search:** $O(dm)$, where $d$ is the alphabet size and $m$ is the string length.
  - **Insert/Delete:** $O(dm)$.

#### **Example:**

For the set $S = \{ \text{bear, bell, bid, bull, buy, sell, stock, stop} \}$, the trie efficiently stores shared prefixes like "b" and "s".

---

### **3. Compressed Tries**

- **Definition:**
  - Derived from a standard trie by compressing paths of single-child nodes into one edge.
- **Advantages:**

  - Reduces the number of nodes and edges, saving space.
  - Facilitates faster traversal by skipping intermediate nodes.

- **Representation:**
  - Nodes store indices of substrings instead of full strings.

---

### **4. Suffix Tries**

- **Definition:**

  - A trie built from all suffixes of a string $X$.
  - Compressed to eliminate redundant nodes and paths.

- **Applications:**

  - Efficient pattern matching within $X$.
  - Commonly used in text processing tasks like DNA sequence analysis.

- **Performance:**
  - Construction: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of $X$.
  - Pattern matching: $O(dm)$, where $m$ is the pattern length.

#### **Example:**

For the string $\text{minimize}$, suffixes like $\text{minimize}, \text{inimize}, \text{nimize}, \dots$ are stored in the trie.

---

### **5. Applications of Tries**

- **Text Indexing:**
  - Store large datasets for quick retrieval (e.g., Shakespeare's works).
- **Pattern Matching:**
  - Match strings against a set of patterns efficiently.
- **Auto-Complete:**
  - Predict next characters based on prefixes.
- **Spell Checking:**
  - Quickly verify word validity.

## ‚ùì **Questions Raised**

1. How do compressed tries perform on very large datasets compared to standard tries?
2. Can suffix tries be adapted for approximate string matching?
3. What are the trade-offs between tries and hash-based data structures?
