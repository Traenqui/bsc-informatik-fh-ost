## üìñ **Detailed Notes**

### **1. Directed Graphs (Digraphs)**

- **Definition:**

  - A directed graph $G = (V, E)$ consists of vertices $V$ and directed edges $E$ where each edge $(u, v)$ points from $u$ to $v$.
  - Unlike undirected graphs, edges are one-way.

- **Applications:**
  - One-way streets in road networks.
  - Flight routes between airports.
  - Task scheduling and precedence relationships.

---

### **2. Properties of Directed Graphs**

- **Edge Directions:**
  - Edges $(u, v)$ indicate direction from $u$ to $v$; $(v, u)$ is distinct and may not exist.
- **Edge Constraints:**

  - For a simple graph, $m \leq n(n-1)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices and $m$ is the number of edges.

- **Adjacency Representation:**
  - Separate lists for incoming and outgoing edges enable efficient access.

---

### **3. Traversal Algorithms**

- **Directed Depth-First Search (DFS):**

  - Explores edges in their direction only.
  - Classifies edges into:
    - **Tree Edges:** Discovery edges forming the DFS forest.
    - **Back Edges:** Edges leading to an ancestor.
    - **Forward Edges:** Edges to a descendant in the tree.
    - **Cross Edges:** All other edges.

- **Reachability:**
  - A directed DFS from vertex $v$ identifies all vertices reachable from $v$.

---

### **4. Strong Connectivity**

- **Definition:**

  - A directed graph is strongly connected if every vertex can reach every other vertex.

- **Algorithm for Strong Connectivity:**

  1. Perform a DFS from an arbitrary vertex $v$ in $G$.
  2. Reverse the directions of all edges in $G$ (producing $G'$).
  3. Perform another DFS from $v$ in $G'$.

  - If all vertices are visited in both cases, the graph is strongly connected.
  - Complexity: $O(n + m)$.

- **Strongly Connected Components (SCCs):**
  - Maximal subgraphs where all vertices are mutually reachable.

---

### **5. Transitive Closure**

- **Definition:**

  - The transitive closure $G^\*$ of a directed graph $G$ adds a directed edge $(u, v)$ if $G$ has a directed path from $u$ to $v$.

- **Computation:**
  - **DFS-based Approach:**
    - Perform a DFS from each vertex.
    - Complexity: $O(n(n + m))$.
  - **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:**
    - Iteratively considers paths through vertices $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k$.
    - Complexity: $O(n^3)$ using adjacency matrix representation.

---

### **6. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**

- **Definition:**

  - A DAG is a directed graph with no cycles.

- **Topological Sorting:**
  - Orders vertices $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$ such that for every edge $(v_i, v_j)$, $i < j$.
  - Applications:
    - Task scheduling where tasks depend on prior tasks.
- **Algorithms for Topological Sorting:**
  1. **Edge-Based Algorithm:**
     - Iteratively remove vertices with no outgoing edges.
     - Complexity: $O(n + m)$.
  2. **DFS-Based Algorithm:**
     - Perform a DFS and label vertices in reverse post-order.
     - Complexity: $O(n + m)$.

## ‚ùì **Questions Raised**

1. What is the practical impact of edge density on algorithm choice for directed graphs?
2. How can transitive closure computations be optimized for sparse graphs?
3. Can topological sorting handle dynamic changes (e.g., adding edges)?
