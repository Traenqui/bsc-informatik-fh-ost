## üìñ **Detailed Notes**

### **1. Weighted Graphs and Shortest Paths**

- **Definitions:**

  - A weighted graph assigns a numerical value (weight) to each edge.
  - The shortest path between two vertices $u$ and $v$ minimizes the total weight of edges along the path.

- **Applications:**
  - Internet routing.
  - Flight reservations.
  - GPS navigation systems.

---

### **2. Properties of Shortest Paths**

- **Subpath Property:**
  - Any subpath of a shortest path is itself a shortest path.
- **Shortest Path Tree:**
  - From a given starting vertex $s$, there exists a tree connecting $s$ to all other vertices with the shortest path to each.

---

### **3. Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm**

- **Assumptions:**

  - The graph is connected, undirected, and edge weights are non-negative.

- **Approach:**

  1. Initialize distances from the source $s$ to all vertices as infinite, except $d(s) = 0$.
  2. Use a priority queue to manage vertices, prioritized by their current shortest distance.
  3. Iteratively:
     - Add the closest vertex $u$ outside the tree to the tree.
     - Relax all edges incident to $u$, updating the shortest paths for its neighbors.

- **Edge Relaxation:**

  - Updates $d(z)$ for edge $(u, z)$:
    $$
    d(z) \leftarrow \min(d(z), d(u) + \text{weight}(u, z))
    $$

- **Data Structures:**

  - Adaptable priority queue with locator-based methods:
    - $\text{insert(k, e)}$: Insert vertex $e$ with key $k$.
    - $\text{replaceKey(l, k)}$: Update the key of locator $l$ to $k$.

- **Complexity:**
  - $O((n + m) \log n)$, assuming adjacency list representation.

### **4. Bellman-Ford Algorithm**

- **Advantages:**

  - Handles graphs with negative edge weights.

- **Approach:**

  1. Initialize distances from source $s$ to all vertices as infinite, except $d(s) = 0$.
  2. Iteratively relax all edges up to $n-1$ times.

- **Limitation:**

  - Does not work with negative weight cycles.

- **Complexity:**
  - $O(n \cdot m)$.

---

### **5. DAG-Based Algorithm**

- **Applicability:**

  - Works efficiently for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
  - Supports negative edge weights.

- **Approach:**

  1. Perform a topological sort of the vertices.
  2. Process vertices in topological order, relaxing outgoing edges.

- **Complexity:**
  - $O(n + m)$.

---

## ‚ùì **Questions Raised**

1. How does edge relaxation ensure correctness in different algorithms?
2. Can Dijkstra's algorithm be adapted for dynamic graphs?
3. What are practical use cases for DAG-based shortest path solutions?
